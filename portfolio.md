I am a career software product architect and 'CTO-for-hire'.

I specialize in helping startups and young companies ride the entreprenurial roller coaster of creating impactful software solutions without scaring themselves to death or running out of capital before making their rightful mark on the world.

If I can assist in lifting the fog, reducing the confusion or breaking down the technical complexity for product stakeholders, I feel that I have done my job.

### Remote Development

Part of successfully wearing the CTO hat - especially as an aging greybeard - entails keeping one's technical skills 'hands-on sharp' wherever one can. Today's tech landscape is broad, deep and constantly evolving, so it can be challenging to balance implementation-level expertise against a CTO's more overarching strategic core duties.

To manage this I typically choose a few technologies that really interest me, and then fill any open time in my calendar with select remote development engagements in these areas. Presently such topics of interest are Apple iOS native app development (especially in Swift) and cross-platform hybrid mobile app development using AngularJS, Ionic and Cordova/PhoneGap.
