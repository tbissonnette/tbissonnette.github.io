The Scrubs & Beyond medical uniforms and supplies shopping/catalog app has been in the App Store since late 2012 and has had more than 40,000 downloads.  Consumers use it to shop for catalog items and collect and redeem mobile offers and coupons.
The native iOS app is based on a white-label mobile app and communications framework built for Omnego Inc., which uses JSON web services to connect securely to a Ruby on Rails + MySQL back-end content management portal.
